# Soil Moisture Monitoring System

## Overview
This project involves the creation of a soil moisture monitoring system using an Arduino sketch and a Python script. The Arduino sketch collects soil moisture data from a capacitive soil moisture sensor and displays it on an LCD screen. The Python script reads this data over serial communication and stores it in a local MySQL database table. Sensitive information is stored in a .env file.

### Hardware Components

- Arduino Uno R3 board
- Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2
- LCD display 16x2
- USB 2.0 Cable Type A/B
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
